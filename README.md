# Mapping national measures in support for the cultural sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic 
## Data visualization

<p>The visualization shows a mapping of emergency measures taken at national level in all EU 27 countries, coming from the public sector (state support) and several private initiatives (such as collecting societies or producersâ€™ associations) in support for the cultural sectors during the health crisis back in 2020.</p>
<p>We developed a categorization which reflects the heterogeneity of adopted support measures and covers the common needs of the specific cultural sub-sectors across Europe. The resulted taxonomy emphasizes 8 categories of support mechanisms relevant for the cultural sector and creatives industries at large.</p>
