# Mapping national measures in support for the cultural sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic 
## Data visualization

<p>The visualization shows a mapping of emergency measures taken at national level in all EU 27 countries, coming from the public sector (state support) and several private initiatives (such as collecting societies or producersâ€™ associations) in support for the cultural sectors during the health crisis back in 2020.</p>
<p>We developed a categorization which reflects the heterogeneity of adopted support measures and covers the common needs of the specific cultural sub-sectors across Europe. The resulted taxonomy emphasizes 8 categories of support mechanisms relevant for the cultural sector and creatives industries at large.</p>
<p>Technology used:</p>


* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

<p>Libraries used:</p>

* Bootstrap
* D3 library (Sankey Diagram)
* Leaflet mapping

<p>The Sankey diagram represents the flow of the categorized support measures into the cultural sectors.</p>
<p>The map shows the European countries in which a specific flow (a specific measure for a specific sector) was implemented.
Clicking on a country reveals the details of the flow.</p>
